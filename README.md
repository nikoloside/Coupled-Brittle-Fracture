# Coupled Phase-Field Brittle Fracture Simulation

A phase-field brittle fracture mechanics code written in [Nutils](http://www.nutils.org/en/latest/) is coupled to a Poisson equation in FEniCS. The FEniCS code is a place-holder for a proper corrosion model and currently provides dummy material parameters (fracture toughness). The coupling is realized with [preCICE](https://www.precice.org/). The purpose of this code is to showcase how preCICE could be used to volume-couple between an electro-chemistry model (here the FEniCS code) and a fracture mechanics model.

The original fracture mechanics code was developed by [Clemens Verhoosel](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/clemens-verhoosel/). The model is documented in this publication:

The coupling prototype was developed by [Benjamin Uekermann](https://github.com/uekerman).

## Dependencies

* Python3 (e.g. 3.6, but any new version should work)
* numpy (e.g. 1.18, but any new version should work)
* matplotlib (e.g. 3.0, but any new version should work)
* [Nutils v6](https://pypi.org/project/nutils/) 
* [treelog](https://github.com/evalf/treelog) (should already be fetched as dependency of nutils)
* [preCICE v2](https://github.com/precice/precice/releases/tag/v2.1.0)
* [pyprecice v2](https://pypi.org/project/pyprecice/) 
* [FEniCS v2019.1](https://fenicsproject.org/download/)
* FEniCS-preCICE adapter: [branch `delete-connectivity` from this fork](https://github.com/uekerman/fenics-adapter/tree/delete-connectivity)

## Folder structure

- `Allclean`: a bash script to clean the case 
- `corrosion.py`: the dummy corrosion model, implemented with FEniCS
- `corrosion.cpp`: a similar dummy corrosion model, implemented with DOLFIN
- `Poisson.ufl`: the corresponding DOLFIN unified form language file
- `CMakeLists`: cmake specification to build the DOLFIN code  
- `dummy.py`: an alternative dummy code, which can also provide material parameters
- `fracture.py`: the fracture mechanics, implemented with Nutils
- `precice-config.xml`: the preCICE configuration file, describing the coupled setup
- `README.md`

## Building

The DOLFIN code is the only one that needs building

```bash
ffc -l dolfin Poisson.ufl
cmake .
make
```

Be sure to use the same `ffc` version as used for the linked `libdolfin`.

## How to run

Open two terminals and start one program in each directly from the root directory:
* `python3 corrosion.py` or `./demo_corrosion`
* `python3 dummy.py`

## Visualization

Both codes write vtk data, which can be visualized for example with [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).

## On the characteristic length scale l0

l0 acts as a numerical regularization parameter for the phase field model. It controls the width of the smooth approximation of the crack. In the limit case of l0 going to zero, the phase-field approximation converges to the discrete fracture surface. The parameter could, however, also be regarded as a model parameter: the critical stress for which crack nucleation occurs depends on it. For smaller l0, the critical stress increases. For the limit case, fracture nucleation is impossible in the absence of stress singularities. For too large values of l0, on the other hand, the complete damage field is already above the critical damage value. Whatever happens then could be regarded as unphysical model artifacts. In particular, fractures cannot be localized properly. Given the total load, the Lam√© parameters, and the fracture toughness, l0 needs to be tuned such that the initial virgin damage field is below the critical damage value (approximately 0.25, better below 0.1). Additionally, l0 still needs to be larger than the local mesh size.
